What are samples?
=================

When the crawler visits a page, the page is matched against each sample and samples with more annotations take precedence over those with less. If the page matches a sample, data will be extracted using the sample's annotations to yield an item (assuming all required fields are filled). Samples exist within the context of a spider and are made up of annotations which define the elements you wish to extract from a page. Within the sample you define the item you want to extract as well as mark any fields that are required for that item.

What are annotations?
=====================

An annotation defines the location of a piece of data on the web page and how it should be used by the spider. Typically an annotation maps some element on the page to a particular field of an item, but there is also the option to mark the data as being required without storing the data in an item. It's possible to map attributes of a particular element instead of the content if this is required, for example you can map the ``href`` attribute of an anchor link rather than the text.

Annotations
===========

Creating annotations
--------------------

You can create annotations by clicking an element on the page with the appropriate tool selected. You should use the wand (|icon-wand|) most of the time as it will select the appropriate tool automatically. The following tools are available:

* |icon-wand| - Select the most appropriate tool when clicking on an element
* |icon-select| - Select an element
* |icon-add| - Add an element
* |icon-sub| - Remove an element
* |icon-add-repeat| - Add repeating element

Extractors
----------

    :alt: Field extractors

You can also add extractors to annotations. Extractors let you use regular expressions or a pre-defined type to further refine data extracted from a page.

For example, assume there's an element that contains a phone number, but it has additional text that you don't need. In this scenario you could add an extractor to retrieve only the phone number instead of the full text.

Multiple fields
---------------

It's possible to extract multiple fields using a single annotation if there are several properties you want to extract from an element. For example, if there was an anchor link on the page, you could map the ``href`` attribute containing the URL to one field, and you could map the text to another. You can view a particular annotation's settings by either clicking the cog in the annotation pop-up window or by clicking the cog beside the annotation in the ``Annotations`` section of the sample configuration. Within this context there is an ``Attribute mappings`` section where you can define additional mappings for the selected annotation should you want to map other attributes.

Multiple samples
================

It's often necessary to use multiple samples within one spider, even if you're only extracting one item type. Some pages containing the same item type may have a different layout or fields missing, and you will need to accommodate those pages by creating a sample for each layout variation.

The more annotations a sample has, the more specific the data being extracted and therefore less chance of a false positive. For this reason, samples with more annotations take precedence over those with less annotations. If a subset of samples contains equal number of annotations per sample, then within that subset samples will be tried in the order they were created from first to last. In other words, samples are tried sequentially in order of number of annotations first, and age second.

If you are working with a large number of samples, it may be difficult to ensure the correct sample is applied to the right page. It's best to keep samples as strict as possible to avoid any false matches. It's useful to take advantage of the ``-just required-`` option and annotate elements that will always appear on matching pages to reduce the number of false positives.

Consider the following example:

We have an item type with the fields ``name``, ``price``, ``description`` and ``manufacturer``, where ``name`` and ``price`` are required fields. We have created a sample with annotations for each of those fields. Upon running the spider, many items are correctly scraped; however, there are a large number of items where the manufacturer field contains the description, and the description field is empty. This has been caused by some pages having a different layout:

Layout A:

.. code-block:: html

    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>name</td>
                <td>price</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">manufacturer</td>
            <tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">description</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

Layout B:

.. code-block:: html

    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>name</td>
                <td>price</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">description</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

As you can see, the problem lies with the fact that in layout B the description is where manufacturer would be, and with ``description`` not being a required field it means that the sample created for layout A will match layout B. Creating a new sample for layout B won't be enough to fix the problem, as layout A's sample would contain more annotation and be matched against first.

Instead we need to modify layout A's sample, and mark the ``description`` annotation as **Required**. With this added constraint, items displayed with layout B will not be matched against with layout A's sample due to the missing ``description`` field, so the spider will proceed onto layout B's sample which will extract the data successfully.
